Project Title: Stock Price Prediction

Overview:
This project develops a machine learning model to predict stock prices using historical data. It employs various algorithms to analyze trends and make future price predictions, aiming to aid investors in decision-making.

Key Steps:

Data Collection: Gather historical stock data and relevant features.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize data, and engineer features.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize data to identify patterns and correlations.
Model Selection and Training: Experiment with algorithms, tune parameters, and train models.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like MSE and RMSE.
Deployment: Deploy the trained model for real-time predictions.
Additional Considerations:

Ensure compliance with ethical and regulatory standards.
Update the model regularly with new data for accuracy.
Incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement.
